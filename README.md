# MiniPicoLisp
[MiniPicoLisp] is a reduced 32-bit [PicoLisp] especially suitable for embedded
systems. It is a minimal version, without support for databases, UTF-8,
bignums, IPC, networking and other system-dependent functions.
A kind of "pure" PicoLisp (not "pure Lisp"!).

For more details on the implementation, see [MiniPicoLisp Code in ROM].
